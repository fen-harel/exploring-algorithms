# Big'O Time-Space complexity

Approximate growth with respect to input.

Constants are mostly ignored as mostly the worst case scenario is taken into account.

Meaning : 20N -> O(N), N+29 -> O(N)

`N = 1, O(10N) = 10, O(N^2) = 1 N = 5, O(10N) = 50, O(N^2) = 25 N = 100, O(10N) = 1000, O(N^2) = 10,000 // 10x bigger`

N^2 complexity, although much slower for larger programs, are actually faster than 10N
in shorter cases.

### O(n logn)

Half the ammount needed to search (logn), but must search once throughout length of input n to do so

### O (log n)

Binary search trees

### O (sqrt(n))
